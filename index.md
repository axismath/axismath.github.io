<p>I'm an experienced math teacher who offers personalized, one-on-one mathematics tutoring for students in grades 6-12, in-person or online.</p>

<p>I specialize in, but am not limited to, <b>Algebra</b>, <b>Geometry</b>, <b>Trigonometry</b>, and <b>Pre-Calculus</b>.</p>

<p>I have clients throughout San Diego, especially in the neighborhoods of <b>Torrey Highlands</b>, <b>Rancho Peñasquitos</b>, <b>Carmel Valley</b>, <b>Rancho Santa Fe</b>, <b>Del Mar</b>, and <b>La Jolla</b>.</p>

<p>If you or your student are struggling in class — or simply want to feel empowered while problem solving — I can help! We'll work together to develop a custom learning plan tailored to your specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as your individual goals and curriculum.</p>

<p>You'll learn new approaches and content, strengthen your analytical and problem solving skills, and build the confidence needed to tackle assignments and overcome test anxiety. Most importantly, you'll develop a <b>true step-by-step understanding</b> of the material.</p>
